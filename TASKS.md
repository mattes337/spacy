# Audio/Video Text Extractor - Tasks and TODOs

## Testing Results Summary

✅ **Completed and Working:**
- Basic FastAPI application structure
- File upload endpoints (`/process-audio`, `/process-video`)
- Health check endpoint (`/health`)
- Basic error handling for unsupported file formats
- Temporary file management with proper cleanup
- Vector database client structure
- Docker configuration
- Requirements specification

❌ **Issues Found During Testing:**

### 1. Dependency Installation Issues
- **Problem**: spaCy, Whisper, MoviePy, and related ML dependencies fail to install on Python 3.13/Windows due to compilation issues
- **Impact**: Core functionality cannot be tested with real models
- **Status**: Blocking issue for production deployment

### 2. Missing Dependencies
- **Problem**: `python-multipart` was missing from requirements.txt
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed - Added to requirements.txt

### 3. File Handling Issues
- **Problem**: Windows file permission errors when deleting temporary files
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed - Improved file cleanup with proper exception handling

## High Priority Tasks

### 1. Dependency Compatibility
- [ ] **Update Python version compatibility** - Test with Python 3.9-3.11 instead of 3.13
- [ ] **Alternative dependency versions** - Find compatible versions for Windows/newer Python
- [ ] **Pre-compiled wheels** - Use pre-compiled packages where available
- [ ] **Conda environment** - Consider using conda for better ML package management

### 2. Model Loading and Initialization
- [ ] **Lazy model loading** - Load spaCy and Whisper models only when needed
- [ ] **Model download verification** - Ensure spaCy model downloads successfully
- [ ] **Graceful fallback** - Handle cases where models fail to load
- [ ] **Model caching** - Implement proper model caching strategy

### 3. Error Handling and Robustness
- [ ] **Comprehensive error handling** - Add try-catch blocks for all external library calls
- [ ] **Input validation** - Validate file sizes, formats, and content
- [ ] **Timeout handling** - Add timeouts for long-running operations
- [ ] **Memory management** - Handle large files without memory overflow

### 4. Audio/Video Processing
- [ ] **Audio format conversion** - Handle various audio formats consistently
- [ ] **Video codec support** - Test with different video codecs and containers
- [ ] **Audio extraction optimization** - Optimize MoviePy audio extraction
- [ ] **Chunk processing** - Process large files in chunks

## Medium Priority Tasks

### 5. API Improvements
- [ ] **Request validation** - Add Pydantic models for request/response validation
- [ ] **File size limits** - Implement reasonable file size limits
- [ ] **Rate limiting** - Add rate limiting for API endpoints
- [ ] **Authentication** - Add API key or token-based authentication
- [ ] **CORS configuration** - Configure CORS for web client access

### 6. Performance Optimization
- [ ] **Async processing** - Make audio/video processing truly asynchronous
- [ ] **Background tasks** - Use FastAPI background tasks for long operations
- [ ] **Caching** - Cache transcription results
- [ ] **Parallel processing** - Process multiple files concurrently

### 7. Monitoring and Logging
- [ ] **Structured logging** - Implement proper logging with levels
- [ ] **Metrics collection** - Add processing time and success rate metrics
- [ ] **Health checks** - Expand health check to verify model availability
- [ ] **Error tracking** - Implement error tracking and alerting

### 8. Configuration Management
- [ ] **Environment variables** - Use env vars for configuration
- [ ] **Model selection** - Allow runtime model selection (base, small, medium, large)
- [ ] **Processing parameters** - Configurable transcription parameters
- [ ] **Storage configuration** - Configurable temporary file storage

## Low Priority Tasks

### 9. Vector Database Integration
- [ ] **Real vector DB client** - Implement actual vector database integration
- [ ] **Embedding generation** - Add text embedding generation
- [ ] **Batch indexing** - Support batch operations for multiple files
- [ ] **Search functionality** - Add search endpoints

### 10. Testing and Quality Assurance
- [ ] **Unit tests** - Write comprehensive unit tests
- [ ] **Integration tests** - Test with real audio/video files
- [ ] **Performance tests** - Load testing with various file sizes
- [ ] **Docker testing** - Test Docker build and deployment

### 11. Documentation and Examples
- [ ] **API documentation** - Generate OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- [ ] **Usage examples** - Provide client code examples
- [ ] **Deployment guide** - Document deployment procedures
- [ ] **Troubleshooting guide** - Common issues and solutions

### 12. Security Enhancements
- [ ] **Input sanitization** - Sanitize uploaded file content
- [ ] **Virus scanning** - Integrate virus scanning for uploads
- [ ] **Secure file storage** - Implement secure temporary file handling
- [ ] **Access controls** - Implement proper access controls

## Development Environment Setup

### Recommended Next Steps:
1. **Set up Python 3.9-3.11 environment** for better dependency compatibility
2. **Use conda or virtual environment** with specific Python version
3. **Test dependency installation** before proceeding with development
4. **Create mock/test mode** for development without heavy ML dependencies

### Alternative Approaches:
- **Docker development** - Use Docker for consistent environment
- **Cloud deployment** - Deploy to cloud with pre-configured ML environment
- **Separate services** - Split ML processing into separate microservices

## Notes
- Current implementation includes a working mock version for testing API structure
- File upload and basic processing flow is functional
- Vector database client structure is ready for integration
- Docker configuration is complete but untested due to dependency issues
