# Audio/Video Transcription Service - Development Tasks

## Service Status Summary

✅ **Core Transcription Service - Completed:**
- FastAPI application structure for transcription endpoints
- File upload endpoints (`/process-audio`, `/process-video`)
- Health check endpoint (`/health`) for agent monitoring
- Error handling for unsupported file formats
- Temporary file management with proper cleanup
- Structured JSON output format for agent consumption

- Test files organized in `__test__/` directory

❌ **Critical Issues for Transcription Service:**

### 1. ML Dependencies Compatibility
- **Problem**: spaCy, Whisper, MoviePy fail to install on Python 3.13/Windows
- **Impact**: Transcription models cannot load, blocking agent integration
- **Priority**: CRITICAL - Required for production transcription service

### 2. Missing Dependencies
- **Problem**: `python-multipart` was missing from requirements.txt
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed - Added to requirements.txt

### 3. File Handling Issues
- **Problem**: Windows file permission errors when deleting temporary files
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed - Improved file cleanup with proper exception handling

## Development Environment for Transcription Service

### Recommended Setup for Agent Integration:
1. **Python 3.9-3.11 environment** - Required for ML dependencies compatibility
2. **Virtual environment isolation** - Prevent conflicts with agent system dependencies
3. **Docker development** - Consistent environment for agent testing
4. **Mock mode available** - Test agent integration without full ML stack

### Deployment Strategies:
- **Containerized service** - Docker deployment for agent system integration
- **Cloud deployment** - Managed ML environment for production agents
- **Microservice architecture** - Dedicated transcription service for agent ecosystem

## Current Service Status
